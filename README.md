## 🔍 Overview
AI-powered web tool that predicts health risks (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) based on user medical inputs.

## 💡 Motivation
Inspired by my pre-med background, this project combines medical knowledge with AI to explore preventive diagnostics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Streamlit (for UI)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## 📊 Features
- Health input form (age, bp, glucose, etc.)
- ML model prediction (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- Data visualization (correlations, risk factors)
- Model comparison section


## 🧪 Sample Inputs
| Feature       | Value  |
|---------------|--------|
| Age           | 45     |
| Blood Pressure| 130    |
| Glucose Level | 165    |
| BMI           | 28.5   |

## 📈 Model Accuracy
- Decision Tree: 86%
- Logistic Regression: 83%

## 📁 Dataset
Used `Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset` from Kaggle  

## 🧠 Future Plans
- Add early cancer or stroke risk models
- Include data from wearable devices
